            <p>My positive influence in my life is Lonzo Ball because of his mentally towards the game. He has a quite appoarch towards the media which I like because it shows is character.His father Lavar ball has a big mouth says the media but they take it out on Lonzo in my opinion thats not right to take it out on him or not doing or saying anything to Lavar. I really love the ball family and their hustle to change the game they have alredy change the game by Lonzo being the first nba player to come in the league with his on shoe.</p>

            <p>Lonzo has a unique style on and off the floor he doesnt really talk much but he is a fun person to be around. He is also a rapper to and has a cool flow more of a ovo ting aye but his rhymes on the beat math his play on the court meaing its smooth and wavy. Lonzo teaches me to be humble to the game and to block out all the noise and continue to do you no matter what people say. He aslo teaches me that you dont have to be a floower but you can become your own boss and control your destiny. </p>

            <p>To be a big baller you have be able to stay in your lane and be willing to change the game. You have to be williing to take risks that might be scary at first but you have to be willing to go for it no matter what. If you wan to make in the game dont worry about the last person focus on you keep your dfamily close to you and never change on them for nothing.Lonzo who is 20 has proven alot for sa 20 year old in the league. the maturity that he has is unspeakable from the news to the press he is sti focus on the big prize and that is becoming the best ball player in the league.  </p>

            <p>Lonzo ball youngest brother also teach him adn many of us how to set an example for your younger sibilings. You make the right choice not the bad one becuase you know your sibilings are watching. His style off the court with his shoes have influence me alsp because I like his clothing line. The road to riches wasnt easy you have to be the best at what you do to succed at what you do. He was a star on the court in college and played threw alot of advisory there to with his mother having a stroke ge was able to play a full game. He still is the most talked about player in the league earning respect from names such as kobe and Lebron. Even thoe he is hurt right now and his coach wont let him play alot because of his dads mouth he still is on his way to being a legend. Just gotta give him time and trust the process that he woluld be great. Thats why i look up to Lonzo ball being hte the greatest player to lpay the game.  </p>
